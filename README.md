Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network

This project is part of my Semester Project at EURECOM dealing with uncertainty estimation using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks.
In this repo you may find two different notebooks.
Each Notebook has been trained on a different dataset where uncertainty estimation techniques have been developed and commented.
In order to access the training data for the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset, kindly access the official DR Challenge on Kaggle.
As for the MNIST dataset it was retrieved from Yann LeCunn's implementation.
